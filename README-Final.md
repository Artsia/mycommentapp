## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Material UI Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Netlify


### What I learned

- React hooks vs State management Libraries
- Material UI components


### Continued development

- Will focus more on react hooks usecases. I plan on creating the Youtube comment section where users can make live comments, see what other users justed commeted and edit/ delete their post. 


### Useful resources

-- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library - This helped me to understand web hooks, react-dom tree, rendering and much more. They have an easy to understand documentaion and examples. 

-- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) - JS FrameWork - Saved me alot of time because components are already designed. A few adjustments but better than writting the whole css file from scratch. I liked their live code playground which allowed me to see components and adjust attributes before adding to my project.
